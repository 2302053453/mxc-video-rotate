iMX display rotate patch
========================

Generate a patch
----------------

It may be more convenient to patch freescale kernel instead of make an external
module. You can generate patch for freescale kernel using:

     git diff original mxc_ipuv3_fb.c > 0001-add-support-for-screen-rotation.patch

Change file paths in patch header in order to comply with your build
environnement.
